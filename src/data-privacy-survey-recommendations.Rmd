  In the second quarter of 2022, Utrecht University (UU) Research Data Management 
  Support (RDM Support) sent out a survey among all scientific personnel at UU,
  and organised one-on-one meetings with a selection of them. The aim of these
  efforts was to investigate 1) How UU researchers currently deal with personal 
  data in their research, 2) What challenges they run into when handling 
  personal data in research, and 3) How support at UU can improve their 
  services concerning personal data in research. The results showed that most 
  researchers knew to take privacy into account in their projects. However, 
  there were vast differences in knowledge on this topic, as well as in how privacy-
  related practices were applied. Many researchers expressed concerns on the current
  quantity, findability and quality of privacy-related support at UU. These 
  concerns were translated to recommendations in the current report. In short,
  our recommendations concern organising privacy-related research support
  in a way that makes handling personal data less of a burden for researchers. 
  Moreover, it is important to increase the visibility and findability of existing
  and new privacy-related support, and create materials and expertise that are 
  more tailored to academic practice. Taking up these recommendations within the
  organisation will likely both increase overall GDPR compliance and help 
  researchers focus more on performing high-quality research.

# Introduction {#introduction}
Scientific research often includes some form of personal data. The amount of 
personal data that is processed in research is likely underestimated, as 
researchers may be unaware of what personal data are or whether they are being 
collected. With the implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation
(GDPR) in 2018, stricter legal requirements apply to handling personal data and 
its sharing and publication. In our own experience, the number and complexity of 
questions on handling personal data in scientific research at Utrecht University
(UU) is increasing. 

Our premise at <a href = "https://uu.nl/rdm" target = "_blank">Research Data 
Management Support</a> (RDM Support) is to assist researchers with any issues 
surrounding the management of their research data, including research data that 
contains personal data. To understand how we can best help researchers with 
their privacy-related questions and needs, we wanted to investigate:

1. To what extent are UU researchers aware of privacy legislation and practices?
2. What data privacy issues do UU researchers typically run into?
3. What support do UU researchers need to handle personal data?

To answer these questions, we set up an online survey and planned one-on-one 
meetings with a selection of UU researchers. This report summarises our findings,
and describes recommendations to improve privacy-related services for research
at Utrecht University. For a full description of the methods and results, please 
refer to the
<a href = "data-privacy-survey-report.html" target = "_blank">Data Privacy Survey Report</a>.

This survey was part of a larger project at UU, the <a href = "https://utrechtuniversity.github.io/dataprivacyproject/" 
target = "_blank">Data Privacy Project</a>^[The Data Privacy Project is funded 
by Utrecht Universityâ€™s Research IT program and a Digital Competence Center 
grant from the Dutch Organization for Scientific Research (NWO). It is led by Utrecht 
University's <a href="https://uu.nl/rdm/" target = "_blank">Research Data 
Management Support</a>, in collaboration with the University Library, 
Information Technology Services, first- and second-line privacy officers, 
information security, and others.]. This project is a data support effort within 
UU that aims to provide actionable and FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, 
Reusable) information and tools for researchers to handle personal data in their 
research. 

# Methods summary {#methods}

The Data Privacy Survey consisted of two main parts:

- An online survey that was sent to all of UU's scientific personnel via email, 
asking about researchers' common data types, current practices
in handling personal data in their research, awareness of data support channels, 
and challenges and needs in this area.
- One-on-one meetings with individual researchers to talk about their experiences,
challenges and needs in this area.
