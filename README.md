# Data Privacy Survey

This repository contains the code for analysing the data from the Data Privacy Survey. The code can be found in the `docs` folder as an R markdown file.

The R markdown file has been knitted to html so the script's results can be viewed in a <a href="docs/survey-first-glance.html" target="_blank">web browser</a>.

As the raw dataset contains personal data in the form of demographic information, free text, and email addresses, it is not shared in this repository.

## About the Data Privacy Survey
In the second quarter of 2022, Utrecht University Research Data Management Support (RDM Support) sent out a survey among all scientific personnel at Utrecht University: the Data Privacy Survey. The aim of this survey was to investigate 1) How UU researchers currently deal with personal data in research, 2) What challenges they run into when handling personal data in research, and 3) How RDM Support and collaborators can improve their services and support concerning personal data in research.

The survey was set up during the <a href="utrechtuniversity.github.io/dataprivacyproject" target="_blank">Data Privacy Project</a>.
