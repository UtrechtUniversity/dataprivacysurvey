# Data Privacy Survey

In the second quarter of 2022, Utrecht University (UU) Research Data Management Support (RDM Support) sent out a survey among all scientific personnel at Utrecht University: the Data Privacy Survey. The aim of this survey was to investigate 1) How UU researchers currently deal with personal data in research, 2) What challenges they run into when handling personal data in research, and 3) How RDM Support and collaborators can improve their services and support concerning personal data in research.

The survey is part of the <a href="https://utrechtuniversity.github.io/dataprivacyproject" target="_blank">Data Privacy Project</a>, an RDM Support  project to improve information, tools and services surrounding personal data in research. More information about this survey can be found in the following files:

## This repository

This repository contains the code for analysing the data from the Data Privacy Survey. The code can be found in the current GitHub repository (`src` folder) as an R markdown file. As the raw dataset contains personal data in the form of demographic information, free text, and email addresses, it is not shared in this repository. The code for pseudonymising the dataset is shared however (see `src` folder), for full transparency on how the survey data were processed.
