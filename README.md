## About the Data Privacy Survey
In the second quarter of 2022, Utrecht University Research Data Management Support (RDM Support) sent out a survey among all scientific personnel at Utrecht University: the Data Privacy Survey. The aim of this survey was to investigate 1) How UU researchers currently deal with personal data in research, 2) What challenges they run into when handling personal data in research, and 3) How RDM Support and collaborators can improve their services and support concerning personal data in research.

The survey was set up during the <a href="https://utrechtuniversity.github.io/dataprivacyproject" target="_blank">Data Privacy Project</a>.
