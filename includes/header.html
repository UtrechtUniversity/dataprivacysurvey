    "name": "Data Privacy Survey: Challenges and needs of privacy-related services for research at Utrecht University",
    "description": "In the second quarter of 2022, Utrecht University (UU) Research Data Management Support (RDM Support) sent out a survey among all scientific personnel at UU, and organised one-on-one meetings with a selection of them. The aim of these efforts was to investigate 1) How UU researchers currently deal with personal data in their research, 2) What challenges they run into when handling personal data in research, and 3) How support at UU can improve their services concerning personal data in research. The results showed that most researchers knew to take privacy into account in their projects. However, there were vast differences in knowledge on this topic, as well as in how privacy-related practices were applied. Many researchers expressed concerns on the current quantity, findability and quality of privacy-related support at UU. These concerns were translated to recommendations for support personnel. We describe the methodology and results of the survey and the one-on-one meetings with researchers, both for the entire UU, as well as for each UU faculty separately.",
