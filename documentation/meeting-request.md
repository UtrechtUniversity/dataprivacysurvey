# Meeting request email

*To organise the one-on-one meetings with individual researchers, we sent an email to all researchers who left their email address in the online survey. 
The email can be found below.*


Dear [name], 
  
Thank you for filling out the <a href="https://intranet.uu.nl/en/news/news-items/survey-better-support-for-handling-privacy-sensitive-data-in-research" target="_blank">Data Privacy Survey</a>! 
You are receiving this email, because you indicated to be open for a conversation on privacy in research. 
We are emailing you to confirm that we have received your response and that weâ€™d like to plan an appointment with you when possible. 
We've received more than 35 responses to plan a meeting and we're looking forward to meeting everyone. 
To make the planning a bit easier, could you let us know the following: 

1.	**Would you indeed like to meet with us? 
Or was there another reason for you to leave your email address?**<br>
We would like to talk to you about the topic of handling personal data in research. 
For example: what made you leave your email address, how can we improve our privacy-related services?   
We aim for a meeting of approx. 30 minutes to minimize the burden on your time. 
The meeting will be with two people involved in the Data Privacy Project (RDM Support, University Library), with at least one of the project coordinators present (Neha or Dorien).   
If you did not want to meet with us, but had other reasons to leave your email address: please let us know!
2.	**If you would like to meet:**  
  - Do you have a preference on where you would like to meet?<br>
    This could be online via Teams, or in-person at Utrecht Science Park or City Center.
  - Do you have a preference on when to meet?<br>
    E.g., specific times or days?
  - Are you open to having your faculty privacy officer present at this meeting?<br>
    The privacy officer can potentially help you out with questions or suggestions you may have. 
    Importantly, it is also completely fine to meet with just Neha and Dorien from RDM Support. 
  
Thank you in advance for your response. 
If you would not like to meet or hear from us, please also let us know, so we won't spam you unnecessarily! 
 
Best wishes, 
Neha Moopen and Dorien Huijser 

Project Coordinators, Data Privacy Project (RDM Support, University Library)
